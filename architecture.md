## Architecture Documentation: Application Feedback Submission Feature

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 27, 2023
**Feature Name:** Application Feedback Submission
**Author:** Senior Solution Architect

---

### 1. Architecture Overview

The Application Feedback Submission feature is designed as a modular extension to the existing application architecture, enabling users to easily provide text-based feedback with an optional email address. The primary goal is to establish a robust, secure, and scalable channel for user input, directly aiding continuous application improvement.

**Key Design Principles:**

*   **Modularity & Decoupling:** The feature will be implemented as a distinct component within the existing frontend and a new, dedicated API endpoint within the backend, promoting independent development and deployment.
*   **Reusability of Existing Stack:** Adherence to the current technology stack (frontend framework, backend framework, database system, CI/CD pipeline) to minimize overhead and leverage existing expertise (Dependencies & Constraints).
*   **Security by Design:** Proactive measures for input validation, data sanitization, secure communication, and data protection from the outset (NFR2).
*   **User-Centric Design:** Focus on an intuitive user interface and clear feedback mechanisms (NFR3).
*   **Scalability & Reliability:** Design components to handle anticipated load and ensure high availability (NFR4, NFR6).

**High-Level Components:**

1.  **Client-Side UI:** The user-facing component, integrated into the existing application's frontend. It provides the feedback form, handles client-side validation, and communicates with the backend API.
2.  **Feedback Service (Backend API):** A new, dedicated API endpoint within the existing backend framework responsible for receiving, validating, sanitizing, and persisting user feedback.
3.  **Database:** The existing application's database system will be leveraged to securely store the submitted feedback.

This architecture supports the collection of valuable user insights while being seamlessly integrated into the current application ecosystem.

---

### 2. Cloud Strategy

The architecture for the Feedback Submission feature will fully leverage the **existing application's public cloud provider** (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP – *as not specified, generic cloud services will be referenced*). This approach aligns with the "Technology Stack" constraint and "Existing Application" dependencies.

**Deployment Model:** Public Cloud, specifically utilizing managed services where possible to offload operational burden and enhance reliability and scalability.

**Key Cloud Services Utilized:**

*   **Compute Services:**
    *   **Existing Application Frontend:** Served via a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and/or object storage (e.g., Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage) for high availability and low latency access to the UI assets (NFR1.1).
    *   **Backend Feedback Service:** Deployed on existing compute infrastructure (e.g., container orchestration like Kubernetes (EKS/AKS/GKE), managed application services like AWS Elastic Beanstalk / App Runner, Azure App Service, Google App Engine, or EC2/VMs) to ensure scalability and resilience for the `/api/feedback` endpoint (NFR4.1).
*   **Networking & Load Balancing:**
    *   **API Gateway / Load Balancer:** The existing API Gateway (e.g., AWS API Gateway, Azure API Management, Google Cloud API Gateway/Load Balancer) will route traffic to the new `/api/feedback` endpoint (Dependency 4). This layer also provides critical features like SSL/TLS termination, basic rate limiting (NFR2.4 - future consideration), and WAF integration.
    *   **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) / Virtual Network:** Ensures secure internal communication and network isolation.
*   **Database Services:**
    *   **Managed Relational Database Service:** The new `feedback` table (FR6.1) will reside within the existing managed database instance (e.g., Amazon RDS, Azure SQL Database, Google Cloud SQL – PostgreSQL/MySQL) (Dependency 3). This provides automated backups, patching, scaling options, and high availability (multi-AZ deployments) (NFR4.2, NFR6.1).
*   **Monitoring & Logging:**
    *   **Cloud-Native Observability Tools:** Leveraging existing centralized logging (e.g., CloudWatch Logs, Azure Monitor Logs, Google Cloud Logging) and monitoring (e.g., CloudWatch Metrics, Azure Monitor Metrics, Google Cloud Monitoring) to track performance, errors, and system health for the new feature (Assumption 7). This includes API response times, error rates, and database performance (NFR1.2, NFR6.2).

This strategy ensures that the feedback feature benefits from the robust infrastructure and operational maturity of the existing cloud environment.

### 3. Microservices Design

The Application Feedback Submission feature adheres to microservices principles by introducing a logical separation of concerns. While the existing application's backend might be a monolith or a suite of existing microservices, this feature will introduce a new, well-defined module/service responsible *solely* for feedback submission.

**Service Boundaries and Responsibilities:**

1.  **Frontend Feedback Module:**
    *   **Type:** A UI component or module within the existing client-side application (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js component).
    *   **Responsibilities:**
        *   Display the "Feedback" access point (FR1.1).
        *   Render the feedback submission form (FR1.2, FR2).
        *   Implement client-side validation for mandatory fields (FR3.1).
        *   Capture user input (FR3.2).
        *   Initiate HTTP POST requests to the backend API (FR4.1).
        *   Handle and display success/error messages to the user (FR4.2, FR4.3, NFR3.2).
        *   Provide cancel/close functionality (FR2.4).
        *   Ensure responsiveness across devices (NFR3.3).
    *   **Technology:** Existing application's frontend framework (Dependency 1).

2.  **Feedback Service (Backend API Endpoint):**
    *   **Type:** A new API endpoint (`/api/feedback`) exposed by the existing backend application or a new dedicated microservice if the overall architecture supports fine-grained service decomposition. Given the simple requirements, it's likely a new endpoint/controller within the existing backend application (Constraint: Technology Stack; Dependency: Backend Framework).
    *   **Responsibilities:**
        *   Expose a secure HTTP POST endpoint (`/api/feedback`) (FR5.1).
        *   Receive and parse incoming JSON request bodies (FR5.2).
        *   Perform server-side validation, ensuring `feedbackText` is present (FR5.3).
        *   Sanitize input data (`feedbackText`, `userEmail`) to prevent injection attacks (FR5.5, NFR2.2).
        *   Interact with the database to securely store feedback records (FR6.4).
        *   Return appropriate HTTP status codes (200/201 for success, 400 for bad request, 5xx for server errors) (FR5.4).
    *   **Technology:** Existing application's backend framework (Dependency 2).

**Service Interactions (Textual Representation):**

```
[User Browser]
      | (HTTP/S GET: Load Application UI)
      v
[Frontend Application (CDN/Web Server)]
      | (User Interaction: Clicks 'Feedback', Fills Form)
      |
      | (HTTP/S POST: Feedback Data {feedbackText, userEmail}) -- FR4.1, NFR2.1
      v
[API Gateway / Load Balancer] -- (Routes to appropriate backend service)
      |
      v
[Feedback Service (Backend)] -- (Receives, Validates, Sanitizes) -- FR5
      |
      | (Database Connection / ORM) -- FR6.3
      v
[Database (feedback table)] -- (Secure Storage) -- FR6
      |
      | (Database Operation Result)
      v
[Feedback Service (Backend)] -- (Returns HTTP 200/201 or 4xx/5xx) -- FR5.4
      |
      v
[API Gateway / Load Balancer]
      |
      v
[Frontend Application (User Browser)] -- (Displays Success/Error Message) -- FR4.2, FR4.3
```

This clear separation allows for focused development, testing, and potential scaling of the feedback submission capability independently of other application functionalities.

### 4. Data Flow & Integration

The data flow for the Application Feedback Submission feature is straightforward, following a request-response pattern:

1.  **User Initiates Feedback (FR1, FR2):**
    *   A user navigates within the application and clicks a prominently displayed "Feedback" option.
    *   The frontend application renders a modal or dedicated page containing the feedback form.
    *   The user enters feedback text (mandatory) and optionally an email address.

2.  **Client-Side Processing (FR3):**
    *   Upon clicking "Submit," the frontend performs client-side validation (FR3.1) to ensure the feedback text is not empty.
    *   If validation passes, the captured data (`feedbackText`, `userEmail`) is prepared as a JSON payload (FR5.2).

3.  **API Request to Backend (FR4.1):**
    *   An asynchronous HTTP POST request is sent from the client-side application to the backend API endpoint `/api/feedback`. All communication is secured via HTTPS/SSL/TLS (NFR2.1).

4.  **Backend API Gateway/Load Balancer:**
    *   The API Gateway or Load Balancer receives the request and, based on configured routing rules (Dependency 4), forwards it to an available instance of the Backend Feedback Service. This layer also provides initial security measures like DDoS protection.

5.  **Feedback Service Processing (FR5):**
    *   The Feedback Service receives the POST request.
    *   It performs server-side validation to ensure `feedbackText` is not empty (FR5.3). If invalid, a 400 Bad Request is returned (FR5.3.1).
    *   The incoming `feedbackText` and `userEmail` are thoroughly sanitized to prevent XSS and other injection vulnerabilities (FR5.5, NFR2.2).
    *   The sanitized data is then prepared for database insertion.

6.  **Database Persistence (FR6):**
    *   The Feedback Service connects to the existing database system (Dependency 3).
    *   It securely executes an INSERT operation to add a new record to the `feedback` table (FR6.4), ensuring parameterized queries or ORM solutions are used to prevent SQL injection (FR6.3).
    *   The `id`, `feedback_text`, `user_email`, and `submission_date` fields are populated as per the schema (FR6.2).

7.  **Backend Response (FR5.4):**
    *   If the database insertion is successful, the Feedback Service returns a 200 OK or 201 Created HTTP status code.
    *   If an internal error occurs (e.g., database connection issue), an appropriate 5xx status code is returned.

8.  **Client-Side Confirmation/Error (FR4.2, FR4.3):**
    *   The frontend application receives the backend response.
    *   If successful, a confirmation message is displayed to the user, and the form is cleared/closed.
    *   If an error occurred, a user-friendly error message is displayed, and the form remains open with input intact, allowing the user to retry.

**Integration Points:**

*   **Frontend-Backend API:** Primary integration through RESTful API calls.
*   **Backend-Database:** Secure data access layer using database connectors and ORM/Parameterized queries.
*   **Existing Infrastructure:** Leverages existing API Gateway, Load Balancer, and CI/CD pipeline.

### 5. Scalability & Reliability

Designing for scalability and reliability is crucial for a continuously improving application.

**Scalability Strategies (NFR4):**

*   **Horizontal Scaling of Backend Service (NFR4.1):**
    *   The Backend Feedback Service will be designed as stateless, allowing multiple instances to run concurrently behind the Load Balancer/API Gateway.
    *   Cloud compute services (e.g., Kubernetes, EC2 Auto Scaling Groups, Azure App Service Plans) provide automatic scaling capabilities based on metrics like CPU utilization or request queue length, ensuring the service can handle increasing loads.
*   **Database Scalability (NFR4.2):**
    *   Leverage the managed database service's features such as read replicas (though not strictly necessary for simple write-only feedback) and automatic storage scaling.
    *   The simple `feedback` table schema with appropriate indexing (`id`, `submission_date`) will ensure efficient write operations and future querying as data volume grows.
*   **Frontend Scalability:**
    *   Frontend assets served from a CDN are inherently scalable, distributing content closer to users and offloading origin servers.
*   **Rate Limiting (NFR2.4 - Future):** While out of scope for initial launch, the API Gateway layer provides an ideal place to implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage, which is a key scalability measure.

**Reliability Strategies (NFR6):**

*   **Redundancy and High Availability (NFR6.1):**
    *   **Multi-AZ Deployment:** Deploying the Backend Feedback Service and the managed database across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within the chosen cloud region. This ensures that if one AZ experiences an outage, the service remains available.
    *   **Load Balancing:** Distributes incoming traffic across healthy instances of the Feedback Service.
    *   **Database Failover:** Managed database services automatically handle failover to a standby replica in case of primary instance failure.
*   **Error Handling and Resilience (NFR6.2):**
    *   **Client-Side Graceful Degradation:** The UI provides clear error messages and allows users to retry submission if a network or backend error occurs, retaining their input.
    *   **Server-Side Robustness:** The Backend Feedback Service includes comprehensive error handling for database interactions and external dependencies, preventing cascading failures.
    *   **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** Consider implementing circuit breakers (e.g., using libraries like Polly in .NET, Hystrix in Java) for database interactions to prevent the backend from being overwhelmed by a failing database and allow it to recover gracefully.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting (Assumption 7):**
    *   Comprehensive monitoring of API endpoint response times, error rates, and database health metrics.
    *   Automated alerts configured to notify the operations team of any deviations from baselines or critical errors, enabling proactive intervention.
    *   Centralized logging for quick troubleshooting and post-mortem analysis.
*   **Idempotency (Future Consideration):** While not critical for feedback submission, designing the API to be idempotent (if a unique ID could be generated client-side for each submission) could improve reliability for retry mechanisms.

By combining these strategies, the Feedback Submission feature will be highly resilient, capable of operating smoothly even under stress or partial failures.

### 6. Security Considerations

Security is paramount and will be integrated throughout the design and implementation of the Feedback Submission feature (NFR2).

*   **Secure Communication (NFR2.1):**
    *   All data transmission between the client application and the backend API will enforce HTTPS/SSL/TLS encryption. This protects data in transit from eavesdropping and tampering.
    *   The API Gateway/Load Balancer will handle SSL/TLS termination with valid certificates.
*   **Input Validation & Sanitization (NFR2.2):**
    *   **Client-Side Validation (FR3.1):** Basic validation (e.g., ensuring feedback text is not empty) provides immediate user feedback and reduces unnecessary network traffic.
    *   **Server-Side Validation (FR5.3):** Mandatory and robust server-side validation is implemented as the ultimate gatekeeper, preventing malformed or malicious data from reaching the database.
    *   **Data Sanitization (FR5.5):** All user-provided text (`feedbackText`, `userEmail`) will be properly sanitized before storage. This includes HTML entity encoding or other context-aware output encoding to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks when feedback is later viewed or processed.
*   **Database Security (FR6.3):**
    *   **SQL Injection Prevention:** All database interactions will use parameterized queries or Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. Direct string concatenation in queries is strictly forbidden.
    *   **Least Privilege:** The backend service's database credentials will adhere to the principle of least privilege, having only the necessary permissions (e.g., `INSERT` into `feedback` table) and no more.
    *   **Encryption at Rest:** Leverage the managed database service's capabilities for encryption of data at rest (e.g., AES-256 for disk volumes) to protect sensitive information in case of unauthorized access to storage.
    *   **Encryption in Transit (Internal):** Ensure secure connections (SSL/TLS) between the backend service and the database instance if not handled implicitly by the managed service.
*   **API Security (NFR2.4):**
    *   **API Gateway Protection:** The API Gateway can be configured with a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious traffic patterns (e.g., common OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities).
    *   **Rate Limiting:** As a future enhancement (NFR2.4), implement rate limiting on the `/api/feedback` endpoint to mitigate denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and prevent excessive submissions.
*   **Data Privacy (NFR2.3):**
    *   The collection of email addresses is explicitly optional and will be handled in accordance with the application's established privacy policy.
    *   User email addresses will not be exposed publicly and access will be restricted to authorized internal systems and personnel only.
*   **Compliance (Constraint 2):** All development will strictly adhere to the organization's existing security policies and best practices, including regular security reviews and penetration testing.

### 7. DevOps & CI/CD

The development and deployment of the Application Feedback Submission feature will fully integrate into the existing DevOps practices and CI/CD pipeline (Dependency 5). This ensures rapid, reliable, and consistent delivery.

*   **Version Control:**
    *   All code (frontend, backend, database schema) will be managed in a version control system (e.g., Git).
    *   Branching strategy (e.g., Git Flow, GitHub Flow) will be followed for feature development, bug fixes, and releases.

*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
    *   While the feature leverages existing infrastructure, any new resources or configurations (e.g., database table definition, API Gateway routing rules, scaling policies) will be defined using IaC tools (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi). This ensures environment consistency and repeatability.

*   **Continuous Integration (CI):**
    *   **Automated Builds:** Every code commit will trigger an automated build process for both frontend assets and backend service images (e.g., Docker images).
    *   **Unit Testing (AC13):** Comprehensive unit tests will be run automatically as part of the build pipeline for both frontend and backend code, ensuring individual components function as expected.
    *   **Static Code Analysis:** Tools will scan code for quality, adherence to coding standards (NFR5.1), and potential security vulnerabilities early in the development cycle.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Automated scans for known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.

*   **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD):**
    *   **Automated Testing (AC13):**
        *   **Integration Tests:** After a successful build, automated integration tests will verify the interaction between the Frontend Feedback Module and the Backend Feedback Service, as well as the Backend Service's interaction with the database.
        *   **Frontend Tests:** UI tests to ensure the form renders correctly, client-side validation works, and success/error messages are displayed (AC2, AC3, AC5, AC6).
        *   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Automated E2E tests will simulate a complete user journey, from form access to successful database persistence, ensuring the entire feature works as expected in an integrated environment (AC1, AC4, AC7, AC9).
    *   **Deployment Pipeline (Dependency 5):**
        *   Upon successful completion of all tests, the built artifacts will be automatically deployed to staging environments for further testing and validation.
        *   Deployment to production will follow established procedures, ideally leveraging blue/green or canary deployment strategies to minimize downtime and risk during releases (NFR6.1).
        *   Automated database schema migrations will be handled as part of the deployment pipeline to ensure the `feedback` table is correctly provisioned (FR6.1).

*   **Monitoring & Logging (Assumption 7):**
    *   The CI/CD pipeline will ensure that appropriate logging and monitoring configurations are deployed alongside the new feature.
    *   Dashboards will be created to visualize key metrics (e.g., submission success rate, response times, error rates) and alerts configured for immediate notification of issues (NFR1.2, NFR6.2).
    *   Distributed tracing can be configured to track requests across the frontend, API Gateway, Feedback Service, and database, aiding in debugging and performance analysis.

This integrated DevOps approach ensures that the Application Feedback Submission feature can be developed, tested, and deployed efficiently and reliably, aligning with the "Timeframe" constraint and promoting continuous improvement.

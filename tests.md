Excellent, a well-structured application with clear separation of concerns, comprehensive validation, and a good start on unit tests. This sets a solid foundation. Now, let's build out a truly comprehensive test suite, focusing on the robustness and resilience of this feedback submission feature.

### Comprehensive Test Suite Design: Application Feedback Submission

As a senior QA engineer, my goal is to ensure this feedback system is not only functional but also secure, performant, and delightful for users. We'll leverage the existing test coverage and expand upon it significantly.

---

### **1. Unit Tests**

**Purpose:** To verify that individual components (classes/functions) function correctly in isolation, with their dependencies mocked. This ensures the smallest testable parts of the application meet their specifications.

#### **Backend Unit Tests (Java/Spring Boot)**

**A. Component: `FeedbackService`**
*   **Existing Tests:** `testSubmitFeedback_success`, `testSubmitFeedback_sanitization`, `testSubmitFeedback_noEmail`.
*   **Augmented Scenarios & Edge Cases:**
    *   **Scenario:** `submitFeedback` with feedback text exactly minimum length (10 characters).
        *   **Expected Outcome:** Successfully saves the feedback.
    *   **Scenario:** `submitFeedback` with feedback text exactly maximum length (2000 characters).
        *   **Expected Outcome:** Successfully saves the feedback.
    *   **Scenario:** `submitFeedback` with feedback text containing significant leading/trailing whitespace.
        *   **Expected Outcome:** The whitespace is trimmed *before* sanitization and persistence. (e.g., " Some text " becomes "Some text").
    *   **Scenario:** `submitFeedback` with `userEmail` containing significant leading/trailing whitespace.
        *   **Expected Outcome:** The whitespace is trimmed *before* sanitization and persistence. (e.g., " user@example.com " becomes "user@example.com").
    *   **Scenario:** `submitFeedback` with empty `userEmail` string.
        *   **Expected Outcome:** `userEmail` is persisted as `null` in the `Feedback` object. (The DTO already handles `""` to `null` on the frontend, but the service should confirm its handling).
    *   **Scenario:** `submitFeedback` where `feedbackRepository.save` encounters a transient database error (e.g., network glitch, temporary connection loss).
        *   **Expected Outcome:** The exception is propagated (as `feedbackService` doesn't catch it), leading to a `500 Internal Server Error` at the controller level.
    *   **Scenario:** `submitFeedback` with feedback text consisting solely of spaces (after trim, it becomes empty).
        *   **Expected Outcome:** This should be caught by `@NotBlank` at the controller level before reaching the service. If it somehow bypasses, `feedbackRepository.save` would likely fail due to `nullable = false` on `feedback_text`.
*   **Potential Testing Challenges:**
    *   Ensuring `HtmlUtils.htmlEscape` correctly handles all edge cases of XSS (e.g., double encoding, uncommon character sets). This is typically an area for security testing or using a more robust library like OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer.
    *   Verifying `@Transactional` behavior programmatically in a unit test is difficult and generally left for integration tests.

**B. Component: `FeedbackController`**
*   **Existing Tests:** `testSubmitFeedback_success`, `testSubmitFeedback_emptyFeedbackText_badRequest`, `testSubmitFeedback_shortFeedbackText_badRequest`, `testSubmitFeedback_invalidEmail_badRequest`, `testSubmitFeedback_internalServerError`.
*   **Augmented Scenarios & Edge Cases:**
    *   **Scenario:** Valid feedback with `userEmail` exactly maximum length (255 characters).
        *   **Expected Outcome:** 201 Created.
    *   **Scenario:** Valid feedback with `userEmail` exceeding maximum length (256+ characters).
        *   **Expected Outcome:** 400 Bad Request, with a JSON error detailing `userEmail` validation failure (`maxlength` message).
    *   **Scenario:** Valid feedback with `userEmail` containing valid special characters (e.g., `user.name+alias@sub.domain.co.uk`, `firstname.lastname@domain.co.in`).
        *   **Expected Outcome:** 201 Created.
    *   **Scenario:** Request body is malformed JSON (e.g., missing a quote, extra comma).
        *   **Expected Outcome:** 400 Bad Request (Spring's default `HttpMessageNotReadableException`).
    *   **Scenario:** Request with `feedbackText` field explicitly `null` (not just an empty string).
        *   **Expected Outcome:** 400 Bad Request with `feedbackText` validation error (`@NotBlank` handles `null`).
    *   **Scenario:** Request to unsupported HTTP method (e.g., `GET /api/feedback`).
        *   **Expected Outcome:** 405 Method Not Allowed.
    *   **Scenario:** Request from an unauthorized CORS origin (if `WebConfig` were restrictive to only `localhost:4200` but request came from `localhost:8081`).
        *   **Expected Outcome:** Browser's console shows CORS error, request potentially blocked. (This is more a browser/frontend concern, but important to note for API testing).
*   **Potential Testing Challenges:**
    *   Simulating all types of `MethodArgumentNotValidException` errors precisely.
    *   Testing `GlobalExceptionHandler` directly in unit tests might involve creating mock `MethodArgumentNotValidException` instances, which can be verbose. However, `@WebMvcTest` effectively covers this.

#### **Frontend Unit Tests (Angular)**

**A. Component: `FeedbackFormComponent`**
*   **Existing Tests:** Covered basic form validation and service interaction.
*   **Augmented Scenarios & Edge Cases:**
    *   **Scenario:** `feedbackText` field with exactly minimum length (10 chars).
        *   **Expected Outcome:** Form field `feedbackText` is valid.
    *   **Scenario:** `feedbackText` field with exactly maximum length (2000 chars).
        *   **Expected Outcome:** Form field `feedbackText` is valid.
    *   **Scenario:** `feedbackText` field exceeding maximum length (2001+ characters typed).
        *   **Expected Outcome:** `maxlength` error appears for `feedbackText`.
    *   **Scenario:** `userEmail` field with exactly maximum length (255 chars).
        *   **Expected Outcome:** Form field `userEmail` is valid.
    *   **Scenario:** `userEmail` field exceeding maximum length (256+ characters typed).
        *   **Expected Outcome:** `maxlength` error appears for `userEmail`.
    *   **Scenario:** Successful submission then attempting to resubmit (button should be disabled while submitting, and form reset after success).
        *   **Expected Outcome:** Submit button becomes "Submitting...", then disabled, then form resets. No double submission should occur.
    *   **Scenario:** Backend returns a 400 validation error that the *client-side didn't catch* (e.g., a custom backend regex validation for email not mirrored exactly).
        *   **Expected Outcome:** `submissionStatus` is 'error', `errorMessage` updates, and the specific field (e.g., `userEmail`) shows the backend-provided error message.
*   **Potential Testing Challenges:**
    *   Accurately simulating user input (typing) and focus/blur events to trigger Angular's dirty/touched state for validation messages.
    *   Testing the visual rendering of error messages or success alerts often involves querying the DOM directly with `fixture.nativeElement.querySelector`, which is more integration-like than pure unit.

**B. Service: `FeedbackService`**
*   **Existing Tests:** `should be created`, `should send a POST request to submit feedback`, `should send a POST request with null email if not provided`.
*   **Augmented Scenarios & Edge Cases:**
    *   **Scenario:** `submitFeedback` with `feedbackText` containing leading/trailing spaces.
        *   **Expected Outcome:** The `HttpClient` request payload for `feedbackText` still contains the spaces (trimming happens on backend).
    *   **Scenario:** `submitFeedback` with `userEmail` containing leading/trailing spaces.
        *   **Expected Outcome:** The `HttpClient` request payload for `userEmail` still contains the spaces (trimming happens on backend).
    *   **Scenario:** `submitFeedback` when the backend returns a non-2xx status code (e.g., 400, 500).
        *   **Expected Outcome:** The `Observable` returned by `submitFeedback` should emit an error.
*   **Potential Testing Challenges:**
    *   Ensuring `environment.apiUrl` is correctly picked up by tests; `HttpClientTestingModule` handles this well by intercepting requests.

#### **Test Data Requirements for Unit Tests:**
*   Valid strings for `feedbackText` at min, max, and intermediate lengths.
*   Invalid strings for `feedbackText` (empty, too short, too long).
*   Valid email strings (standard, complex, long but valid).
*   Invalid email strings (malformed, too long).
*   Strings with leading/trailing spaces.
*   Strings with special characters and Unicode characters.
*   Known XSS payloads.

---

### **2. Integration Tests**

**Purpose:** To verify the interactions between closely related components (e.g., Controller-Service-Repository on backend, Component-Service-HTTPClient on frontend) within a controlled environment, often using an in-memory database or mocked HTTP backend.

#### **Backend Integration Tests**

*   **Scope:** `FeedbackController` <-> `FeedbackService` <-> `FeedbackRepository` (using H2 in-memory database).
*   **Test Setup:** `@SpringBootTest` with `webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT` and specific `application.properties` pointing to H2.
*   **Scenarios & Edge Cases:**
    *   **Scenario: Full Stack Happy Path Submission:**
        *   **Action:** Send a POST request to `/api/feedback` with valid feedback and email.
        *   **Expected Outcome:** HTTP 201 Created. Verify the response body contains the persisted `Feedback` object with an ID and `submissionDate`. Directly query the H2 database to confirm the entry exists and matches.
    *   **Scenario: Submission without Email (Optional Field Handling):**
        *   **Action:** Send a POST request to `/api/feedback` with valid feedback text but an empty/null `userEmail`.
        *   **Expected Outcome:** HTTP 201 Created. Verify `userEmail` is `null` in the response and in the H2 database record.
    *   **Scenario: Input Sanitization Verification:**
        *   **Action:** Send a POST request with `feedbackText` containing XSS payload (`<script>alert('XSS');</script>`).
        *   **Expected Outcome:** HTTP 201 Created. Verify the `feedbackText` stored in the H2 database is properly HTML-escaped (`&lt;script&gt;alert(&#39;XSS&#39;);&lt;/script&gt;`).
    *   **Scenario: Backend Validation Triggered by Boundary Value:**
        *   **Action:** Send a POST request with `feedbackText` of exactly 9 characters.
        *   **Expected Outcome:** HTTP 400 Bad Request. JSON response indicates `feedbackText` validation error (`minlength`). No entry in DB.
    *   **Scenario: Database Constraint Violation (Hypothetical):**
        *   **Context:** Imagine if `feedback_text` column in DB was smaller than 2000 (e.g., `VARCHAR(1000)`). This is a strong edge case, as `ddl-auto=update` usually aligns them. But if `ddl-auto=none` or `validate` is used in prod, this could occur.
        *   **Action:** Send valid 2000-char `feedbackText` to the API.
        *   **Expected Outcome:** HTTP 500 Internal Server Error (due to `DataIntegrityViolationException` or similar). Backend logs indicate constraint violation.
    *   **Scenario: Concurrent Valid Submissions (Limited Scale):**
        *   **Action:** Use a testing framework (e.g., `JUnit` with `ExecutorService`) to send 5-10 valid `POST` requests almost simultaneously.
        *   **Expected Outcome:** All requests receive 201 Created. All 5-10 distinct entries are found in the H2 database with unique IDs and correct data. No data loss or deadlocks.
*   **Potential Testing Challenges:**
    *   Managing H2 database state between tests (usually handled with `@DirtiesContext` or specific `INSERT`/`DELETE` scripts in `@BeforeEach`/`@AfterEach`).
    *   Simulating specific database errors (e.g., network timeout) without an actual DB outage is hard. Mocking the `DataSource` or `EntityManager` at a lower level would be required, blurring lines with unit tests.

#### **Frontend Integration Tests (Angular)**

*   **Scope:** `FeedbackFormComponent` interacting with `FeedbackService` and displaying results (using `HttpClientTestingModule` to mock HTTP calls).
*   **Test Setup:** `TestBed.configureTestingModule` with `HttpClientTestingModule`.
*   **Scenarios & Edge Cases:**
    *   **Scenario: Successful Submission UI Flow:**
        *   **Action:** Populate `feedbackText` and `userEmail` fields programmatically, trigger `onSubmit()`. Mock `FeedbackService.submitFeedback` to return success.
        *   **Expected Outcome:** The form fields are cleared. The "Thank you for your feedback!" success message is displayed. The submit button is enabled and shows "Submit Feedback".
    *   **Scenario: Server-Side Validation Error Display:**
        *   **Action:** Populate fields with valid client-side data. Trigger `onSubmit()`. Mock `FeedbackService.submitFeedback` to return an HTTP 400 error with a specific error message map (e.g., `{ "userEmail": "Email already registered." }`).
        *   **Expected Outcome:** The `submissionStatus` changes to 'error'. A general `errorMessage` appears. The specific field (`userEmail`) also displays the backend-provided error message. The form fields remain populated (allowing user to correct).
    *   **Scenario: Generic Backend Error Display:**
        *   **Action:** Populate fields. Trigger `onSubmit()`. Mock `FeedbackService.submitFeedback` to return an HTTP 500 error.
        *   **Expected Outcome:** The `submissionStatus` changes to 'error'. The generic `errorMessage` "Failed to submit feedback. Please try again later." is displayed.
    *   **Scenario: Form Reset on Cancel Click:**
        *   **Action:** Fill out parts of the form. Click the "Cancel" button.
        *   **Expected Outcome:** All form fields are cleared, client-side validation messages are removed, and `submissionStatus` is reset to 'idle'.
    *   **Scenario: Submit Button State Management:**
        *   **Action:** Form is invalid -> submit button disabled. Form is valid -> submit button enabled. Click submit -> button says "Submitting..." and is disabled. Submission complete -> button re-enabled.
        *   **Expected Outcome:** Verify these state transitions through DOM queries and component property checks.
*   **Potential Testing Challenges:**
    *   Precisely asserting the visual state (e.g., text content, CSS classes) requires careful use of `fixture.detectChanges()` and `fixture.nativeElement` queries.
    *   Testing the `console.log` statements directly is generally not a priority for functional testing.

#### **Test Data Requirements for Integration Tests:**
*   A dedicated in-memory database (H2 is perfect) for the backend.
*   Similar to unit tests, a wide range of valid and invalid input data.
*   Pre-defined mock HTTP responses for frontend tests, including success, 400 validation, and 500 errors.

---

### **3. End-to-End Tests**

**Purpose:** To validate the entire application flow from a user's perspective, interacting with the real UI, backend, and database. This confirms that all parts of the system work together seamlessly in a deployed environment.

**Tools:** Cypress (for Angular UI interaction), potentially with custom scripts/REST Assured for backend/DB verification.

**Scenarios & Critical User Paths:**

*   **Scenario 1: Happy Path - Complete Feedback Submission (with Email)**
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  Navigate to the feedback form URL (`http://localhost:4200/`).
        2.  Fill `feedbackText` with a valid, long string (e.g., 500 chars).
        3.  Fill `userEmail` with a valid email (e.g., `e2e_user_1@test.com`).
        4.  Click the "Submit Feedback" button.
    *   **Expected Outcome:**
        *   UI: Success message "Thank you for your feedback! It has been successfully submitted." is displayed. Form fields are cleared.
        *   Network: A POST request to `http://localhost:8080/api/feedback` returns 201 Created.
        *   Database: Verify a new record exists in the Oracle `feedback` table with the submitted text, email, and a valid `submission_date`.

*   **Scenario 2: Happy Path - Feedback Submission (without Email)**
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  Navigate to the feedback form.
        2.  Fill `feedbackText` with a valid string.
        3.  Leave `userEmail` field empty.
        4.  Click "Submit Feedback".
    *   **Expected Outcome:**
        *   UI: Success message displayed, form cleared.
        *   Network: POST request returns 201 Created.
        *   Database: Verify a new record exists with the text, and `user_email` is `NULL`.

*   **Scenario 3: Client-Side Validation Prevents Submission**
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  Navigate to the feedback form.
        2.  Enter "Short" (less than 10 chars) into `feedbackText`.
        3.  Do NOT enter `userEmail`.
        4.  Attempt to click the "Submit Feedback" button.
    *   **Expected Outcome:**
        *   UI: "Submit Feedback" button is disabled. An error message "Feedback text must be at least 10 characters." appears below `feedbackText`.
        *   Network: No HTTP request is sent to the backend.

*   **Scenario 4: Server-Side Validation Rejection (e.g., Malicious Input)**
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  Navigate to the feedback form.
        2.  Enter `feedbackText` with a known XSS payload (e.g., `<script>alert('E2E');</script>`).
        3.  Enter a valid `userEmail`.
        4.  Click "Submit Feedback".
    *   **Expected Outcome:**
        *   UI: Success message displayed.
        *   Network: POST request returns 201 Created.
        *   Database: **CRITICAL:** Verify the `feedback_text` in the Oracle database is properly HTML-escaped (`&lt;script&gt;alert(&#39;E2E&#39;);&lt;/script&gt;`). No active script should be stored.

*   **Scenario 5: Form Resilience to Backend Error (500)**
    *   **Pre-condition:** Manually or through a controlled test setup, configure the backend to temporarily return a 500 Internal Server Error for `/api/feedback` requests (e.g., by simulating a DB outage or throwing an exception).
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  Navigate to the feedback form.
        2.  Enter valid `feedbackText` and `userEmail`.
        3.  Click "Submit Feedback".
    *   **Expected Outcome:**
        *   UI: The "Submitting..." state appears briefly, then `submissionStatus` changes to 'error'. A generic `errorMessage` "Failed to submit feedback. Please try again later." is displayed. The form fields are *not* cleared.
        *   Network: POST request returns 500 Internal Server Error.
        *   Database: No new record is inserted.

*   **Scenario 6: Cancel Button Functionality**
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  Navigate to the feedback form.
        2.  Enter partial data into `feedbackText` and `userEmail`.
        3.  Click the "Cancel" button.
    *   **Expected Outcome:**
        *   UI: All form fields are cleared. Any validation messages disappear. `submissionStatus` and `errorMessage` are reset to their initial idle state.

**Test Data Requirements:**
*   **Live Environment:** A deployed instance of both the Angular frontend and Spring Boot backend, connected to an Oracle database.
*   **Database Access:** Direct access to the Oracle database (e.g., via SQL client) to perform assertions on stored data (e.g., `SELECT * FROM feedback WHERE feedback_text LIKE '%E2E%' ORDER BY submission_date DESC;`).
*   **Unique Data:** For each run, use unique feedback text and email (e.g., by appending timestamps `e2e_user_${timestamp}@test.com`) to avoid conflicts and ensure test isolation.
*   **XSS Payloads:** A list of various XSS payloads to test sanitization robustness.

**Potential Testing Challenges:**
*   **Environment Stability:** Ensuring the full stack is consistently available and configured for testing.
*   **Database Cleanup/Seeding:** Implementing robust pre- and post-test hooks to clean or seed the database for consistent results.
*   **Asynchronous Nature:** Handling network delays and UI rendering times; E2E tools must use explicit waits.
*   **Error Injection:** Simulating backend errors (like 500s) directly from E2E scripts can be complex and might require specific tools or mock services.
*   **Test Flakiness:** E2E tests can be prone to flakiness due to network issues, timing, or UI rendering discrepancies. Robust locators and retry mechanisms are crucial.

---

### **4. Performance Test Scenarios**

**Purpose:** To evaluate the system's responsiveness, scalability, and stability under various load conditions, ensuring it meets non-functional requirements.

**Key Metrics to Monitor:**
*   **Response Time:** Average, 90th percentile (P90), and 99th percentile (P99) for POST /api/feedback.
*   **Throughput:** Requests per second (RPS) or transactions per second (TPS).
*   **Error Rate:** Percentage of failed requests (e.g., 4xx, 5xx).
*   **Resource Utilization:** CPU, Memory, Network I/O, Disk I/O on backend and database servers.
*   **Database Metrics:** Connection pool usage, SQL query execution times, I/O rates.

**Tools:** JMeter, Locust, k6, Gatling (for API load testing).

**Scenarios:**

*   **Scenario 1: Baseline Load Test (Normal Usage)**
    *   **Goal:** Establish performance characteristics under typical expected load.
    *   **Configuration:**
        *   Simulate 100 concurrent users.
        *   Each user sends 5 feedback submissions over a 5-minute period.
        *   Ramp-up: 2 minutes.
        *   Payload: Randomly generated valid `feedbackText` (e.g., 50-500 chars) and `userEmail`.
    *   **Expected Outcome:**
        *   Average response time for POST /api/feedback < 300 ms.
        *   Throughput: Stable RPS.
        *   Error Rate: 0%.
        *   Backend CPU < 60%, Memory < 70%.

*   **Scenario 2: Stress Test (Breaking Point / Peak Capacity)**
    *   **Goal:** Determine the maximum sustainable load the system can handle before performance degrades significantly or it fails.
    *   **Configuration:**
        *   Gradually increase concurrent users (e.g., 100 -> 200 -> 300 -> 500 -> 1000...) until unacceptable response times or errors occur.
        *   Duration: Run each load step for 5-10 minutes.
        *   Payload: Randomly generated valid `feedbackText` and `userEmail`.
    *   **Expected Outcome:**
        *   Identify the "saturation point" where response times spike, or error rates climb above a threshold (e.g., >1%).
        *   Pinpoint resource bottlenecks (e.g., database connections, CPU exhaustion on application server).

*   **Scenario 3: Spike Test (Sudden Load Increase)**
    *   **Goal:** Test the system's resilience to sudden, short bursts of high traffic.
    *   **Configuration:**
        *   Maintain a low baseline load (e.g., 20 users).
        *   Suddenly increase load to a high level (e.g., 200 users) for a short period (30-60 seconds).
        *   Drop back to baseline. Repeat 3-5 times.
        *   Payload: Randomly generated valid `feedbackText` and `userEmail`.
    *   **Expected Outcome:**
        *   Response times should spike during the peak load but return to baseline quickly after the spike.
        *   No cascading failures or persistent errors.

*   **Scenario 4: Endurance/Soak Test (Long-Term Stability)**
    *   **Goal:** Detect memory leaks, resource exhaustion, or other issues that manifest over extended periods of continuous operation.
    *   **Configuration:**
        *   Maintain a moderate, consistent load (e.g., 50-70% of the baseline load determined in Scenario 1) for 4-8 hours.
        *   Payload: Randomly generated valid `feedbackText` and `userEmail`.
    *   **Expected Outcome:**
        *   Response times, throughput, and error rates remain stable throughout the test duration.
        *   System resource utilization (especially memory and open file handles) should not show a continuous upward trend.
        *   No unexpected service restarts or failures due to resource exhaustion.

**Test Data Requirements:**
*   **Large Dataset:** A large pool of unique, realistic feedback texts and email addresses (tens of thousands or more) to ensure each submission is unique and to avoid any caching effects.
*   **Data Generation Script:** A script to generate varied `feedbackText` lengths and diverse `userEmail` formats.

**Potential Testing Challenges:**
*   **Environment Replication:** Setting up a performance test environment that accurately mirrors the production environment (including network topology, hardware, and database configuration).
*   **Data Consistency:** Ensuring the generated test data is sufficiently varied and doesn't lead to false positives (e.g., database unique constraint violations if we were testing `user_id` as unique, which isn't the case here).
*   **Monitoring Infrastructure:** Robust APM (Application Performance Monitoring) tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Dynatrace, New Relic) are crucial for deep insights into system behavior during load.
*   **Network Effects:** The performance of the underlying network, load balancers, and firewalls can significantly impact results.
*   **Database Bottlenecks:** Oracle database tuning and monitoring will be critical, as it's the persistence layer and likely to be a bottleneck under high write loads.

### 5. Acceptance Criteria

The following criteria must be met for the feature to be considered complete and ready for release:

*   **AC1: Feedback Access:** A clearly visible "Feedback" button/link is present in the specified location(s) (e.g., main navigation, footer).
*   **AC2: Form Display:** Clicking the "Feedback" button/link successfully opens a form containing: a multi-line text area, an optional email input field, a "Submit" button, and a "Cancel" or "Close" button.
*   **AC3: Mandatory Field Validation:** Attempting to submit the form with an empty "Your Feedback" text area results in a client-side error message and prevents submission.
*   **AC4: Optional Email Input:** Users can optionally enter a valid email address in the "Your Email (Optional)" field.
*   **AC5: Successful Submission Flow (Happy Path):**
    *   Entering feedback text (and optionally an email) and clicking "Submit" successfully sends data to the backend API.
    *   A "Thank you for your feedback!" (or similar) confirmation message is displayed.
    *   The feedback form clears its contents and closes/resets after successful submission.
*   **AC6: Error Submission Flow:**
    *   When a backend or network error occurs during submission, a "Failed to submit feedback. Please try again later." (or similar) error message is displayed to the user.
    *   The form remains open with the user's input intact in this scenario.
*   **AC7: Cancel/Close Functionality:** Clicking the "Cancel" or "Close" button dismisses the feedback form without submitting any data.
*   **AC8: Backend API Functionality:** The `/api/feedback` POST endpoint correctly receives feedback text and optional email, validates the required fields, and responds with appropriate HTTP status codes (200/201 for success, 400 for bad request, 5xx for server errors).
*   **AC9: Database Persistence:** Submitted feedback (feedback text, optional email, and submission timestamp) is securely stored in the `feedback` database table with all fields correctly populated.
*   **AC10: Data Integrity:** The `feedback_text` field is always populated in the database, and `user_email` is correctly nullable/empty when not provided by the user.
*   **AC11: Security Compliance:** The feature adheres to all specified security requirements, including HTTPS, input sanitization, and SQL injection prevention.
*   **AC12: Documentation Completeness:** All required documentation (API, deployment, access/review instructions) for this feature is created and up-to-date.
*   **AC13: Test Coverage:** All specified test types (unit, integration, frontend, E2E) are written and pass successfully for the feature.

### 7. Assumptions

*   A standard web application architecture is in place (client-side application, backend API, database).
*   The application has an existing deployment pipeline that can be extended for this feature.
*   Basic network connectivity between client, server, and database is reliable.
*   No user authentication is *required* for submitting feedback; the feature is open to all users, authenticated or not. If authentication is desired for future features (e.g., associating feedback with a specific user account), it would be a separate enhancement.
*   The application has established logging and monitoring infrastructure that can be leveraged for this feature's backend.

### 8. Out-of-Scope

The following functionalities are explicitly out of scope for this initial release of the Feedback Submission feature:

*   **Admin Dashboard/Interface for Viewing Feedback:** This feature does *not* include any interface for internal teams to view, categorize, or manage the submitted feedback. Feedback will be accessible directly via database queries for initial review.
*   **Feedback Categorization/Tagging:** Users will not be able to categorize their feedback (e.g., "Bug Report," "Feature Request," "General Comment"). All feedback is free-form text.
*   **File Attachments:** Users will not be able to attach files (e.g., screenshots) to their feedback.
*   **Real-time Notifications:** There will be no real-time notifications (e.g., Slack, email alerts) for new feedback submissions to the development team.
*   **Response Mechanism:** The feature does not include any built-in mechanism for the development team to respond directly to user feedback within the application. Follow-up, if needed, would be manual via the optional email.
*   **User Authentication Requirement:** Users are not required to be logged in or authenticated to submit feedback.
*   **Detailed Analytics:** This feature does not include advanced analytics or reporting capabilities on feedback trends or sentiment.
